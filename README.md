# Shivers â€“ A child theme of Hello Elementor

Version: 1.0

Shivers is the first WordPress theme and the first WordPress child theme I have made. The parent theme is Hello Elementor made by Elementor Team.

Shivers uses Bootstrap 4 and WP Boostrap Navwalker.

You are free to copy, use and modify the theme.

## Notice!

At this point Shivers works differently than the parent theme Hello Elementor. Hello Elementor uses index.php as an entry point and loads either Elementor templates or template parts of the theme.

Instead ot that, Shivers has a selection of template files like front-page.php, single.php and page.php so WordPress doesn't need the index.php at all. The index.php of Shivers contains same kind of layout as the page.php and the only template parts it loads are the header and the footer.

Because of these differencies it is possible that template parts made with Elementor plugin won't work with Shivers. Therefore I I recommend to use the original Hello Elementor child theme https://github.com/elementor/hello-theme-child.

I might refactor Shivers in the future and make it more Elementor compatible but I don't promise anything.
